# This scenario simulates a network running a node.
# At certain points, network rules are updated to set
# max block gas to a value that is out of allowed range.
# It is tested that this change is ignored, and the network
# keeps running.

name: Max Block Gas

# The duration of the scenario's runtime, in seconds.

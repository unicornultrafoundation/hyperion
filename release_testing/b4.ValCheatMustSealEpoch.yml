# Scenario B4: When one validator is a cheater, epoch must be sealed immediately. A simulation of a cheater can be done by having two validators using the same validator key.
# - Set up: start 4 validators, 2 RPC nodes and 2 observers
# - Test: process transactions for 1 minutes, then simulate cheat > check for epoch sealing
# - Validation: check list of validator and validate final state of nodes

name: B4
duration: 90 # 1 minute sim > cheat > 30 seconds further
